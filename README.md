"# maze" 

Run the program in one of two ways:

  java Maze

-or-

  java Maze maze.txt

The first method contains no arguments, the second method
contains an argument, in this case "maze.txt", which is the
name of a file containing data for a pre-built maze. 

***Note
added maze2.txt, so the program could also be run:
  java Maze maze2.txt
